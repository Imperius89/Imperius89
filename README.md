### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi! I'm Oscar, a passionate bilingual software analyst and developer with 5 years of experience in the field. My professional career has been focused on creating innovative and efficient technological solutions to meet business needs and improve processes.

I started my career as a Systems Engineer, where I acquired solid knowledge in requirements analysis, solution design and project management. During this time, I worked closely with multidisciplinary teams to understand customer needs and translate them into clear technical specifications.

As my career progressed, I immersed myself in software development, mastering multiple programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, Node.JS, HTML5, CSS, MySQL, and MongoDB. I have been involved in the development of web and mobile applications, from the concept stage to implementation and maintenance. My focus has been on creating scalable, high-performance solutions, using best development practices and the latest technologies available.

In addition, I have worked closely with software quality and assurance teams to ensure the delivery of robust and bug-free products. My ability to identify and solve problems quickly has allowed me to optimize processes and improve the efficiency of the projects I have been involved in.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work in various industries, which has given me a broad perspective and the ability to adapt to different environments.

I am a highly motivated, results-oriented professional with excellent communication skills, innate leadership and teamwork. I love to stay updated on the latest technology trends and participate in challenging projects that allow me to continue to grow and improve my skills.
